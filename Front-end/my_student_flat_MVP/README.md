My Student Flat is an application mainly intended for the student population of Toulouse. It brings together all the affordable apartments (< €800.00) in the city of Toulouse (31). The goal? To allow all these students to not spend all their time in an intense search for housing.

This application could not exist without the collaboration of two individuals with complementary skills. Amandine Assenat (20 years old) is developing the front-end part, an obvious choice given her background as a graphic designer. Valentin Melia (23 years old) is responsible for creating his own API, which gathers all the apartments in Toulouse. This synergy is the result of this project.

**Front-end**

- **Flutter (Dart):** The Dart language has advanced features. Flutter has a simple syntax, allowing for the development of an application in two weeks. Flutter has become popular and offers a wide range of resources. It is also suitable for Android and iOS platforms.

**Back-end**
  
- **Python:** Python is a simple and readable language. It is known for its clear and concise syntax. Python has a large number of libraries for creating APIs, such as Flask, Django, FastAPI, and CherryPy. These libraries facilitate API development and offer many predefined features.
- **MySQL:** MySQL is one of the most popular databases in the world, with a large community of developers and contributors providing abundant documentation and active support.
- **SQLAlchemy:** Enables the connection between web scraping and the database.
- **Flask:** Flask is a library that allows easy customization of an application according to its needs by creating routes.
